This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Ex.1.
```{r}
expected = c(0.38, 0.32, 0.23, 0.07)
observed = c(122, 85, 76, 17)

alpha = 0.1

#H0 observed values have distribution as expected
#H1 not

chisq.test(observed, p=expected)

#P_value > alpha
#no reason to reject H0
```


Ex.2.
```{r}
other = c(0.74, 0.16, 0.1)#expected
her = c(68, 27, 5)#observed

dataFrame = data.frame(other, her)

# H0 the percentage levels are equal
# H1 the percentage levels are different

chisq.test(her, p=other)

# p_value < alpha
#reject H0
# percentages are different

```

Ex.3.
```{r}
expected = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2)
observed = c(43, 50, 44, 44, 52)

# H0 m&ms are equally distributed
# H1 m&ms are not equally distributed

alpha = 0.05

#p_value > alpha so we do not reject H0
# on significance level 

chisq.test(observed, p=expected)
```

Ex.4.
```{r}
data = rep(c(1,3,5,7,9,11), c(7,19,31, 17, 3, 1))
m = mean(data)
s = var(data)
probs = c(pnorm(2,m,s),pnorm(4,m,s) - pnorm(2,m,s), pnorm(6,m,s) - pnorm(4,m,s), pnorm(8,m,s) - pnorm(6,m,s), pnorm(10,m,s) - pnorm(8,m,s), pnorm(Inf,m,s) - pnorm(10,m,s))
data = c(1*7,19*3,31*5, 7*17, 9*3, 11*1)
data = data/sum(data)

alpha = 0.05

chisq.test(data, p =probs)
```

Ex.5.
```{r}

```


Ex.7.
```{r}

urban = c(15, 12, 8 )
suburban = c(8, 15, 9)
rural = c(6,8,7)

df = data.frame(urban, suburban, rural)

# H0 Education has no influence on living location
# h1 Education has an inlfluence on place of living
alpha = 0.05
chisq.test(df)

#p_value > alpha 
# on significance level 5% data does not confirm that the education has no influence on place of living

```

Ex.8.
```{r}
a1 = c(10,90)
a2 = c(7, 93)
a3 = c(4, 96)

dataFrame = data.frame(a1,a2,a3)
# H0 the proportion is the same
# H1 the proportion is different

chisq.test(dataFrame)

#P_value > alpha

#V2

yes = c(10, 7, 4)
no = c(90, 93, 96)
dataFrame = data.frame(yes,no)

chisq.test(dataFrame)
```


Ex.9.
```{r}
forit = c(96,96,90,36)
against = c(201, 189, 195, 234)
noknow = c(3, 15, 15, 30)

dataFrame = data.frame(forit, against, noknow)


# H0 opinion does not depent on age
# H1 opinion depends on age

alpha = 0.05

chisq.test(dataFrame)
#p_value < alpha so we can reject H0
# On significance level 5% data confirms that opinion depends on age

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
