This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Ex.1.
```{r}
yield = read.csv("Reg_1_materials_yield.csv", sep=";")

#a) sample covariance
cov_x_y = cov(yield$X, yield$Y);cov_x_y
#covariance is positive so there exists an increasing relationship between the volume of raw material and the weight of the final product

#b) sample correlation coefficient
cor_x_y = cor(yield$X, yield$Y)
cor_x_y
# the linear relation between the volime of row material and weight
# 0.8 < |cor_x_y| < 1

#c)
plot(yield$X, yield$Y)

#d)
linear_model = lm(yield$Y~ x)
abline(linear_model)

linear_model

#e)
#if we increase the vaolume of raw material by 1 galon we get 3.6 kg of product
#f)
b0 = linear_model$coefficients[1]
b1 = linear_model$coefficients[2]

y = b0 + b1*15
y
x = yield$X
predict(linear_model, data.frame(x=c(15,20)))

#h)

cor_x_y^2

# about 80% is satisfactory
# 80 % of variability explained by variability of volume of raw materials (20% random error)

#i)
#alpha =5
# ho b1 = 0
# h1 b1!= 0

# p -value is smaller than assumed significance level
anova(linear_model)

summary(linear_model)
```
Ex.3.
```{r}
ph = read.csv("Reg_3_bricks.csv", sep =";")
X = ph$Air
Y = ph$Dry
cov(X,Y)

cor(X,Y)

plot(X,Y)

#the more air the density less
model = lm(Y~X)
abline(model)

model 
#Y = 126.24 - 0.917 *X

#if X increases by 1 percent then Y will decrease by 0.917

predict(model,data.frame(X=c(11,23)))

cor(X,Y)^2

#About 75% of variability of Y is explained by X

#1.9
#Ho b1 = 0
#H1 b0 != 0

alpha = 0.01
anova(model)
```

```{r}
liquor = read.csv("Reg_4_liquor.csv", sep =";")
X = liquor$X
Y = liquor$Y
cov(X,Y)

cor(X,Y)

plot(X,Y)

#the more air the density less
linear_model = lm(Y~X)
abline(linear_model)

linear_model 


cor(X,Y)^2

#About 75% of variability of Y is explained by X

#1.9
#Ho b1 = 0
#H1 b0 != 0
plot(X,Y)

alpha = 0.01
anova(linear_model)



square_model = lm(Y~X+I(X^2)+I(X^3)+I(log(X)))
b0 = square_model$coefficients[1]
b1 =square_model$coefficients[2]
b2 =square_model$coefficients[3]

summary(square_model)

predict(square_model, data.frame(X=5.5))

anova(square_model)

ss = seq(1,20,by=1)
plot(ss, predict(square_model, data.frame(X=ss)))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
