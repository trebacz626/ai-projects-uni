Read Data
```{r}
data = read.csv("data_hip.csv", sep=";")
```


Ex.1.

```{r}

wind = c(na.omit(data$wind));wind
#H0 <= 4
#H1 > 4

m = mean(wind);m
t = t.test(wind,alternative = "greater", mu= 4);t
# alplha > p-value 0.05 > 0.017 so we reject H0
# on significance level 5% data confirms that building powerplant is profitable

t = (m - 4)/(sd(wind)/sqrt(length(wind)));t

# our criticial region R is (t(n-1,alpha),Inf)
qt(1-0.05, length(wind)-1)
#R is (1.796, Inf)
#t belongs to R so we reject H0

ttest = function(avg, mu0, sd, n, alpha, type){
  t = (avg - mu0)/(sd/sqrt(n))
  print(paste("pppp",1 -pt(t,n-1)))
  kw = qt(1-alpha, n-1)
  kw2 = qt(1-alpha, n-1)
  if( type == "r"){
    if( t > kw){
      print("Reject H0")
    }else{
      print("No reason to reject H0")
    }
  }else if(type == "l"){
    if( t < -kw){
      print("Reject H0")
    }else{
      print("No reason to reject H0")
    }
  }else if(type =="b"){
    if( (t > kw2) | (t < -kw2)){
      print("Reject H0")
    }else{
      print("No reason to reject H0")
    }
  }
}

ttest(m,4,sd(wind),length(wind), 0.05, "r")
```
Ex.2.
```{r}
#Nuul mean of COP >= 3.5
# h1 mean of COP < 3.5

COP = c(na.omit(data$COP))
m = mean(COP)
mu_0 = 3.5
n = length(COP)
S = sd(COP)

a=0.05
t =t.test(COP, alternative = "less", mu = mu_0)
t


mytest(mean(COP),mu_0,sd(COP), length(COP), a,"l",TRUE,FALSE)
```

Ex.3.
```{r}
temp = c(na.omit(data$temperature))

mu_0 = 54
alpha = 0.01
sig = 2
z.test(temp, sigma.x = sig, alternative = "less",mu=mu_0)

#alpha is less pvalue so there is no reason to reject H0
#on signifigance level 1% data does not confirm that the activation temperature is different than 54

mytest(mean(temp),mu_0,sig, length(temp), alpha,"l",TRUE,TRUE)
```

Ex.4.
```{r}
 depth = c(na.omit(data$depth))

#H0: population mean of depth mu == 870
#H1: population mean of depth mu != 870

alpha = 0.05
sigma = 5
z.test(depth, sigma.x = sigma, mu=870, alternative="less")


mytest(mean(depth),870,sigma, length(depth), alpha,"l",TRUE,TRUE)
#alpha not bigger than p value so we can reject
```

Ex.5.
```{r}
#Ho mu >= 0.04
#H1 mu < 0.04

plates = c(na.omit(data$thickness))

m = mean(plates)
mu_0 = 0.04
n = length(plates)
sig = sd(plates)

a = 0.05
zsum.test(m,sig, n, alternative = "less", mu = mu_0)
#alpha > p_value so we reject H0
#on significnce level 5% data confirms that mean of thickness of all plates is smaller than 0.04
```
Ex.6.
```{r}
length = c(na.omit(data$length))
m = mean(length)
mu = 16
sig = 3
a = 0.05 # default
#a
#H0 mean length of cuckoos egs = 21mm (mu=21)
#h1 mean length of cuckoos egs != 21mm (mu!=21)
t.test(length, mu = mu, alternative = "two.sided")

#p_value < alpha reject H0
#on significance level 5% the dara confirms that the mean length of a cuckoos eggs is different than wren's eggs

#b
#H0 sd of length of cuckoos egs = 3
#h1 sd of length of cuckoos egs != 3
sigma.test(length, sigma = sig, alternative="two.sided")
# there is no reason to reject H0
# The data does not confirm that they are different



zsum.test(length, sig)$conf.int
```




Ex.7.
```{r}
fat = c(na.omit(data$fat))
m = mean(fat)
s = sd(fat)
n = length(fat)
mu_0 = 1.7
alpha=0.05
#a)
#H0 mean fat content in milk == 1.7% (mu = 1.7)
#H1 mean fat content in milk != 1.7% ( mu!= 1.7)

t.test(fat, alternative = "two.sided", mu=mu_0)
#No reason to reject H0
#On significance level 5% data does not confirm H1 hypothesis, which means that data did not confirm that fat content in milk is different than 1.7

#b)
#H0 variance of fat content in milk>= 0.02%^2
#H1 varianceof fat content in milk < 0.02%^2

sigma.test(fat, sigmasq = 0.02, alternative="less")

# pvalue is bigger than alpha
# no reason to reject H0
# on significance level 5%, based on data there is no reson to reject H0
```

Ex.11.

```{r}
#Ho less than 15% of bottles are contaminated
#H1 more than 15% of bottles

n = 91
T = 16
a=0.1

binom.test(T,n, p=0.15, alternative="greater")

#no reason to reject H0
# we should not throw away all bottles
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
