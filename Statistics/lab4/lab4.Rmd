This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
# Task 1
a)
```{r}
set.seed(143)
library(arm)
n=10
p =0.1
k=3
pbinom(k,n,p)
```
b)
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
EX = n*p
SDX = sqrt(n*p*(1-p))
pnorm(k, EX, SDX)
```
c)
When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
```{r}
pnorm(k,EX,SDX) - pnorm(k, EX, SDX)
```
d)
```{r}
for( i in c(20,30,40,100)){
  pb = pbinom(k,i,p)
  pn = pnorm(k,i*p,sqrt(i*p*(1-p)))
  print(abs(pb-pn))
}
```
```{r}
for( p2 in c(0.05,0.1,0.3,0.5)){
  pb = pbinom(k,n,p2)
  pn = pnorm(k,n*p2,sqrt(n*p2*(1-p2)))
  print(abs(pb-pn))
}
n = 100
print("######################")
for( p2 in c(0.05,0.1,0.3,0.5)){
  pb = pbinom(k,n,p2)
  pn = pnorm(k,n*p2,sqrt(n*p2*(1-p2)))
  print(abs(pb-pn))
}
```
```{r}
p = 0.2
samples = 500
par(mfrow = (c(3,1)))
for( n in c(20,200,2000)){
  discrete.hist(rbinom(samples,n, p), xlim=c(0,n))
  x = 0:n
  plot(x,dbinom(x,n,p), type="h", col = "red", xlim=c(0,n))
  plot(x,dpois(x,n*p), type = "h",col = "green", xlim=c(0,n))
}
```
```{r}
p = 0.2
samples = 500
par(mfrow = (c(1,1)))
for( n in c(10,20,200,2000)){
  nums = rbinom(samples,n, p)
  x = 0:n
  curve(dnorm(x, n*p, sqrt(n*p*(1-p))), type="l", col="black", xlim=c(0,n))
  hist(nums, xlim=c(0,n), add=TRUE, freq=FALSE)
  lines(density(nums), col="red")
}
```

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
