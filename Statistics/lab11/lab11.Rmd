This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Ex1
data = read.csv('Anova_pressure.csv', sep=";")

n=40
samples = 10
alpha = 0.05
#H0 mi1=mi2=mi3=mi4
#H1 ~H0

#should be normal
low = data$Niskie
moderate = data$Srednie
strong = data$Silne
veryStrong = data$BardzoSilne

treatments = rep(names(data), each = samples)

results = c(low,moderate,strong,veryStrong)
df = data.frame(treatments, results)
df

#H0 sig1=sig2=sig3=sig4
#H1 ~H0

bartlett.test(results~treatments)
# pvalue higher than alpha so we cannot jest H0

model=lm(results~treatments) 
anova(model) 
#do not reject H0
#the preassure has no effect on final product

```
```{r}

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
