This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data = read.csv(file = "data_twoPop.csv", sep = ";")
```


```{r}
v1 = na.omit(data$cellulose1)
v2 = na.omit(data$cellulose2)

#hypothesis H0: varince is equal 
# H1 variance is not equal

res = var.test(v1, v2)
res
a = 0.02
# p value > 0.02
# variance are equal

#Ho means are qual mu1 == mu2
#H1 means are not equal mu1 != mu2
t.test(v1, v2, var.equal = TRUE)
# p < a
# from 

t.test(v1, v2, var.equal = TRUE, conf.level = 1-a)
#we are 98% sure that the mean difference of cellulose content in wood from two regions of Poland is between -13.52 and 3.14
```
Ex.3.
```{r}
priv = na.omit(data$private)
pub = na.omit(data$public)

#Ho variances are equal
#H1 variance are not equal 
a=0.1
var.test(priv, pub, alternative = "two.sided")
# p_value < a

#H0 pub >= priv
#H1 pub < priv

t.test(pub, priv, var.equal = FALSE, alternative = "less")

#it is reasonable to expect the lones from public sources to be smaller (in avg) than the loans from private

```
Ex.4.
```{r}
# Task 4
player1 = na.omit(data$player1)
player2 = na.omit(data$player2)
a=0.05
#Ho variance sigma1^2 >= sigma2^2
# H1 sigma1^2 < sigma2^2

var.test(player1, player2, alternative = "less")
```


Ex.6.
```{r}
#a
polishN = 1200
polishT = 1200*0.78

usaN = 2000
usaT = 2000 *0.8

polishT;usaT
prop.test(c(polishT, usaT), c(polishN,usaN), conf.level = 1- 0.1)
# 90 confdence that difference between -4.5 to 0.5%


#Ho Pp >= pA
#H1 pP < pS

alpha = 0.1
prop.test(c(polishT, usaT), c(polishN,usaN),alternative = "less")
#p value is smaller than alpha => reject h0
# on s level data confirms H1 hypothesis

#c
#H0 polishP <=0.75
#H1 polishP > 0.75

alpha = 0.1
binom.test(polishT, polishN, p =0.75, alternative = "greater")
# on sig level 10% data confirms that the percentafe of satisfier poles is greater than 75%
```
Ex.10
```{r}
pH15 = c(na.omit(data$pH15))
pH100 = c(na.omit(data$pH100))

difference = pH100 - pH15
difference

#H0 mean difference in PH level is equal 2 0 
#H! there is a difference in mean PH levels
#assume normality
alpha = 0.01
t.test(difference, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided")

#p_value > alpha so there is no reason to reject H0
# The data does not confirm that the PH level depends on depth
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
