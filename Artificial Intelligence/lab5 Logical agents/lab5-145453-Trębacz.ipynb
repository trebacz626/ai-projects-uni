    "We'll concentrate on a very limited subset of propositional logic, namely a *conjunction* of *Horn clauses*. A Horn clause is an *implication* such that its *premise* (*left-hand side*) is a *disjunction* of *atoms* (i.e., *propositonal symbols* or *propositional variables*) and its *conclusion* (*right-hand side*) is a single atom.\n",

    "$$ l \\lor m \\to p $$\n",

    "\n",
    "An implication with a single atom in the premise is also a Horn clause (e.g., $p\\to q$). Without any issues we may also assume that an implication without *any* atoms in the premise is also a Horn clause. In this, we assume that a disjunction of an empty set is always true and thus an implication with an empty premise is, in fact, an atom specified in its conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by defining a *knowledge base* (KB), which will store a conjunction of Horn clauses. In the following class `KB`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Atoms are represented as whatever objects we want as long as they properly support hashing and equality checking. For example, we can use strings.\n",
    "* A clause is a pair such that its first element is a list of atomis in the premise, while the second element is a single object representing the conclusion\n",
    "* `clauses` is a list of clauses.\n",
    "* `symbols` is a set of symbols (atoms) present in all the clauses in the knowledge base.\n",
    "* `add` is a convenience method to add a new implication: its arguments correspond to the elements of a clause (as described above).\n",

We can easily write its contrapositive: *If there isn't a pit in one of the directly adjacent squares, then a square isn't breezy.*.
